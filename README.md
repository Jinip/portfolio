# Portfolio

  This is my dev portfolio. It's not a comprehensive list of all my projects, but it contains various of my works for your viewing pleasure and critique. Enjoy!

## Web
  ### stack-versatility
  This is a simple ToDo app with user authentication and CRUD capabilities written in several different web stacks.
  * Django (Python)
  * LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
  * MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
  * Meteor (built on the MEAN stack: MongoDB, Angular, React, Node)
  * Spring (Java)
  ### animation-design
  Where stack-versatility is about function, these projects are about form. I used them to practice and study various concepts in front end UI design and animation and tried to make them as polished and visually appealing as possible.
  ### projects
  A combination of the above two. These are larger-scale projects incorporating many concepts in my favorite stacks
  
## profile
  This is the source code for my portfolio page. It's a static site built with React-Static.
  
### Work-in-Progress
  Many of the projects listed above aren't yet included, but will be added as older projects are completed. Other projects I'm currently working on to be included a platforming game written in Unity, a Tinder-esque social media mobile app, and some simple machine learning and AI applications I've yet to give proper names. More is always to come.
