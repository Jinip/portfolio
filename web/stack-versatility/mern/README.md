# React Mongo

ERMAHGERD MERN!!!

This is a basic ToDo application on the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)

I tried to find resources that most directly transferred my V School training in Angular to React. Those apps were mainly built on the MEAN Stack comprising Angular with a Bootstrap UI served from an Express server using Mongoose for MongoDB integration.

To that end, this app is React(w/ React-Bootstrap) x Node(Express) x MongoDB
